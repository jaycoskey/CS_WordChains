# WordChains
Use the Boost Graph Library (BGL) to find word chains based on insertions/deletions/mutations/swaps

DONE: Read in list of words, and create cache files that record pairs of words related by a transform (insertion/deletion/mutation/swap).

TODO: Create a graph of which words are linked to which others by these transforms.

TODO: Use this graph to find word chains specified by the user.  (Syntax TBD.)
